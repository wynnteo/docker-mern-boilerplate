# MERN Application
Welcome to our MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application! This project allows you to run a production-ready MERN stack application using Docker. Dockerization simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across different environments.

## Introduction

The MERN application is a full-stack web application that includes a MongoDB database, Express server, React frontend, and Node.js backend. This Readme provides instructions on how to set up and run the application using Docker for local development and production deployment.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. <br/>
2. Make sure you have Docker installed and running on your machine.

## Usage
To run the MERN application locally using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root folder of the cloned repository.
3. Run the following command to build and start the Docker containers:
`docker-compose up --build`
4. The MongoDB, Node.js backend, React frontend, and Nginx server containers will start up.
5. Once the containers are up and running, you can access the application at `http://localhost`.
